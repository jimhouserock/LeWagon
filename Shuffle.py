#Code a manual_shuffle function:

#The function should take one argument, a list, and return a new list with all the items of your original list in a new, randomized order
#Do Not use any built in list methods to manipulate the order such as sort()
#Do Not use the built in shuffle method in pythonâ€™s random library (letâ€™s do it the hard way). But you might find some other helpful methods in there, we imported the random library for you at the top of the file ðŸ˜‰
#Hint: You should not makes changes to the original List, the copy method will come in handy. One approach could be to create a new empty array B, and until A is empty, randomly select an index in A, append the element in A at that index into B, then delete that index in A. Proceed until A is empty. B should contain the new shuffled array!
